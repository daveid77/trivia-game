# Trivia Game

Week Three Homework Part 1: [Javascript Assignment 2](http://ucb.bootcampcontent.com/UCB-Coding-Bootcamp/09-11-2017-UCB-Class-Repository-FSF-FT/blob/master/03-week/homework/part-1/homework-instructions.md).

### No Prerequisites, Installation, or Testing Instructions required

## Misc Notes

* Among game enhancements beyond [demo game](http://ucb.bootcampcontent.com/UCB-Coding-Bootcamp/09-11-2017-UCB-Class-Repository-FSF-FT/raw/master/03-week/homework/part-1/advanced-trivia-demo.mov):
  * **Second "Short Game"** start button offers option with fewer questions and quicker game play (since full game play includes 25 trivia questions, which is a lot for testing and/or reviewing game).
  * **Randomized non-repeating question sequence**, so that questions do not appear in the same order as they are structured in the triviaGame object every time a new game is started.  Since there are so many questions to choose from, this variance keeps replays more fresh. (Short games select from full list of 25 questions.)
  * **Game over audio** reward for user (Stevie Wonder song that inspired this trivia game).  Play/pause toggle remains during further game play after user initiates audio. 
* First three variables in `assets/javascript/app.js` can be modified to control game behavior:
  * Max time for each question to be answered
  * "Short Game" option to set number of questions. 
  * Answer screen display time.
* As always, feedback appreciated.
