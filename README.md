## Misc Notes

* Among the enhancements beyond [demo game](http://ucb.bootcampcontent.com/UCB-Coding-Bootcamp/09-11-2017-UCB-Class-Repository-FSF-FT/raw/master/03-week/homework/part-1/advanced-trivia-demo.mov):
  * Added second "Short Game" start button to quicken game play with fewer questions (since full game play includes 25 trivia questions).
  * Game over audio reward (Stevie Wonder song that inspired this trivia game).
* First three variables in `assets/javascript/app.js` can be modified to control game behavior:
  * Max time for each question to be answered
  * "Short Game" option to set number of questions for quicker game play. 
  * Answer screen display time.
* As always, feedback appreciated.
